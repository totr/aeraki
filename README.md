# Manage **any** layer 7 traffic in Istio service mesh!
![ Aeraki ](docs/aeraki&istio.png)
---
Aeraki [Air-rah-ki] is the Greek word for 'breeze'. While Istio connects microservices in a service mesh, Aeraki provides a framework to allow Istio to support more layer 7 protocols other than just HTTP and gRPC. We hope that this breeze can help Istio sail a little further.

In a nutshell, you can think of Aeraki as the [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) in Istio to automate the envoy configuration for layer 7 protocols.

## Architecture
![ Aeraki ](docs/aeraki-architecture.png)

## Problems to solve

We are facing some challenges in Istio traffic management:
* Istio has very limited built-in support for layer 7 protocols other than HTTP and gRPC.
* It's not feasible to add all these protocols directly into Istio codebase, because it will easily blow up the repository.
* Although you could change Pilot code to support other protocols, maintanence of an Istio fork is inevitable, which makes further upgrading process painful.
* EnvoyFilter could be a possible solution, but it can be very difficult to manually create and maintain those EnvoyFilters, especially in a large service mesh - too many trivial details and moving parts!

To address these problems, Aeraki works alongside Istio, providing an non-intrusive, extendable way to manage any layer 7 traffic in a service mesh.

Aeraki is a standalone component in the service mesh control plane. It follows a non-intrusive design and leverages Istio's [EnvoyFilter API](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/envoy-filter/) to push the configurations to the Envoy sidecar proxies.

Aeraki is a control plane framework for layer 7 protocol traffic management. We plan to support most of the widely used protocols such as [Dubbo](http://dubbo.apache.org/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), [TARS](https://tarscloud.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial), [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/), etc. If you're using a proprietary protocol, you can also write your own Aeraki plugin to support it in a service mesh.

Note:
Although Aeraki is a standalone component, it does depend on Istio [xds-mcp API](https://github.com/istio/api/tree/master/mcp) and the configuration format generated by Pilot.

## Protocol selection
Similar to Istio, protocols are identified by service port prefix. Please name service ports with this pattern: `tcp-protocol-xxxx`. For example, a dubbo service port may be named as `tcp-dubbo-service`. Please keep `tcp` at the beginning of the port name because it is a TCP service from the perspective of Istio.
